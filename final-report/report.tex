\section{Introduction}

\textit{The goal of this project is to design and implement a distributed key-value store in Kompics. We have used well known distrubuted abstraction model to achive this task: }

Our model employs a (static) membership protocol. Data is partisioned using a Hashing function and replicated within each membership nodes. The data consitency among the replicas during in both reads and updates are achived with (N,N) Atomic Register.

\section{Design Overview}
